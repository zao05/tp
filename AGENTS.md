# Project context

This repository is a brownfield Java project based on the existing AB3 address-book application used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students extend and maintain the existing codebase as part of their team project.

The original team-project repository is https://github.com/NUS-CS2103-AY2627-S1/tp.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.
  * For non-trivial feature requests without an approved implementation-ready specification, suggest using `$specify-before-implementing` and follow its stage gates when invoked. Continue to suggest it in future feature-work chats in this repository.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java coding standard

All Java code in this project, including tests and future changes, must follow the project-specific `seedu-java-coding-standard` skill at `.codex/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md`. Read and apply that skill before editing Java. In particular, use lowercase packages, PascalCase class names, camelCase methods and variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants, four-space indentation, K&R braces, explicit imports, a 120-character hard line limit, braces around all control-flow bodies, and descriptive public JavaDoc using American English.

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed.

## JUnit test coverage:

Maintain JUnit tests for approximately the top 50% of methods, prioritizing complex, core, or business-critical logic. After every code change, review and update the relevant JUnit tests so they remain aligned with the implementation and continue to meet this coverage target.

## Git

All future commits and branch names must follow the project-specific `seedu-git-standard` skill at `.codex/skills/seedu-git-standard/SKILL.md`, based on the [SE-EDU Git conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html). Read and apply it before preparing a commit. Commit subjects must be imperative, capitalized, concise, and have no trailing period; non-trivial commits need a 72-column body explaining what and why; branch names must be meaningful kebab-case names, using the issue-number format when applicable.

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
